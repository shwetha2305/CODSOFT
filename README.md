Web Development Internship tasks
Hello everyone I'm Shwetha, and I've finished the tasks that were given to me for this internship. I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript languages here. For each of the three tasks, below are my source codes.

TASKS:
1. Portfolio
2. Landing page
3. Calculator


NOTE: 
1. Please download the images from this repository and then run my code in your local browser after downloading it, to ensure that my entire webpage with the relevant images is displayed.
2. To make the task easier, the javascript and the CSS codes are embedded in the same HTML file.

I thank you looking at my repository. I hope it's helpful to you.
